COMP3025 ASSIGNMENT
BY ADIL NABI    1156212


This application is an assignment for the Course COMP3025 at Lakehead-Georgian

In this assignment I created an application called "Books and Reviews!"

The purpose of this application is to allow users to read and write reviews on various types of books,
allowing people to share their opinions on a list of books that can be expanded by users themselves.

This application works by storing book objects into a firebase database which is then called to populate the book list 
and also the review list of each book.

This application contains various activities with each activity designed for each specific task mind.

The application can only be accessed by an authenticated user via google or email.
